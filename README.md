# Celestial-Origami---Balloon
This program uses the Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit to transform the Mercator projection of a star, planet, or other astronomical object into a 3-D globe. That globe is then split into 6 squares which are chopped up and rearranged so as to make it easy to fold up into an origami balloon!

The colors of each folding tab are found by taking the average color of the original image.

Includes the option to quantize any image and the ability to specify the number of color levelsâ€”this is helpful for images that are blurry as showcased by the Luhman example which is quantized to 12 colors.

Folding instructions included!
